/*
 * THE TFTP PROTOCOL (Server side).
 *
 * Based on RFC 1350 at https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1350.txt with some
 * simplifications. A simple file transfer protocol that reads or writes
 * files to another server working solely under octet mode, passing raw 8 bit
 * bytes of data, and implemented on top of the Internet User Datagram Protocol
 * (UDP / Datagram). Works in parallel with at least one other remote client.
 *
 * Assignment 2: Implementation of the Trivial File Transfer Protocol
 * (TFTP) of G5115 Computer Networks, University of Sussex, Spring 2020.
 * Deadline: May 08, 2020.
